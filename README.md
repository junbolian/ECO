Abstract:


Metaheuristic methods have gained popularity as powerful optimization techniques in contemporary research, seeking to address complex optimization challenges with enhanced efficiency. This study proposes a novel metaheuristic algorithm known as the educational competition optimizer (ECO), tailored to tackle a diverse range of optimization problems. Drawing inspiration from the real-world behavior of students vying for educational resources, ECO leverages the dynamics of competition to refine its search process. To further enhance its efficiency, the algorithm partitions the iterative process into three distinct phases: elementary, middle, and high school. Through this step-wise approach, ECO progressively narrows down the scope of potential solutions, emulating the gradual competition observed within education systems. This stratagem ensures a seamless and resourceful transition from ECO's exploratory phase to its developmental phase. To gauge the efficacy and convergence behavior of ECO, comprehensive evaluations are conducted across 23 classical functions,10 CEC2021 test functions, and several real-world engineering design problems. Empirical results demonstrate that ECO consistently produces near-optimal solutions in the majority of cases, surpassing the performance of nine other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The remarkable success of ECO in efficiently tackling complex optimization problems underscores its potential applicability in diverse real-world domains.
